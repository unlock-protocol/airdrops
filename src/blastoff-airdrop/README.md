# Blast-off Retroactive airdrop

For this airdrop, The Unlock Foundation wants to reward several classes of users:

- Those who have bought paid memberships from Unlock membership contracts
- Those who have attended paid events who used Unlock membership contracts
- Active DAO participants (voters and delegates)
- Active Discord users over the last 6 months
- Selected extensive usage of the protocol for free membership contracts

There is a hard cap to the total number of tokens any address can be elligible for. We also slash by 20% any address who used to have UP or UDT but has sold them.
